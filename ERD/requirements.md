## Notes

- All `PK` fields are primary keys.
- All `FK` fields are foreign keys.
- Arrows ( `<---------` ) represent one-to-many relationships.
- Users can be **hosts** or **guests** (indicated by `role`).
- `properties` belong to a `city`, which belongs to a `state`.
- `bookings` are linked to both `users` and `properties`.
- `payments` relate to `bookings`.
- `reviews` are linked to both `users` and `properties`.
- `messages` are between users (sender â†’ recipient).
